Phase 0 — Vision Lock (1–2 days)

Goal: Prevent scope creep before writing real code.

Deliverables

One-sentence fantasy: “Solve quick, fun riddles to help a hungry pig reach food.”

Hard constraints:

Levels ≤ 3 minutes

Food always visible

No fail states

Finalized core loop (food → riddles → eat → next)

✅ Output: 1-page GDD (very short)
(If it doesn’t fit on one page, it’s too big.)

Phase 1 — Core Prototype (Week 1)

Goal: Make the game playable ASAP.

What to build

One small level

One controllable character (Babi)

One barrier

One riddle type (multiple choice is best)

One food goal

Win condition → next level reload

Ignore for now

Art polish

Sound

Menus

Progression

Success Criteria

Someone can finish a level in under 1 minute

The loop feels obvious without explanation

Phase 2 — Riddle System & Variability (Week 2)

Goal: Make riddles fun, fast, and non-tedious.

Build

Riddle manager (plug-and-play riddles)

At least 4 riddle formats:

Multiple choice

Visual observation

Pattern

Silly/lateral

Instant retry

Friendly wrong-answer feedback

Design Rule

Every riddle must be:

Readable in < 5 seconds

Solvable in < 30 seconds

Success Criteria

Testers smile or laugh at least once

No one asks for hints

Phase 3 — Level Design Pass (Week 3)

Goal: Prove the game can scale.

Create

15–20 micro-levels

Each level:

1–3 barriers max

One visible food

One clear solution path

Introduce choice (multiple barriers)

Add

Simple world themes (visual only):

Kitchen

Farm

Market

Success Criteria

Players finish 5 levels in a row

“Just one more level” effect

Phase 4 — Feedback, Juice & Polish (Week 4)

Goal: Make the game feel good.

Add

Eating animations

Happy / sad Babi reactions

Sound effects (very important)

Small camera shake / glow on success

Improve

Transition speed between levels

Remove all unnecessary UI

Success Criteria

Finishing a level feels rewarding even without points

Phase 5 — Meta Layer (Optional but Powerful) (Week 5)

Goal: Add replay motivation without complexity.

Light additions

Cosmetic unlocks (hats, colors)

Funny eating animations

Bonus food (optional riddles)

🚫 No XP, no grind, no skill trees.

Phase 6 — Playtesting & Cut Ruthlessly (1 week, ongoing)

Goal: Make it tighter, not bigger.

Test for

Any riddle that causes frustration → remove or rewrite

Any level > 3 minutes → split or delete

Any repeated mechanic → vary or remove

Golden Rule

Cutting content improves this game more than adding content.

Final Milestone — Launch-Ready Build

Must-have checklist

30–50 short levels

6–8 riddle types

Zero tutorials

Instant restarts

Strong personality

One Guiding Principle (Write This on the Wall)

If something slows the player down, it must be funny or satisfying — otherwise it doesn’t belong.
